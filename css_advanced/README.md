# Advanced CSS Project - Styling a Homepage

## Project Description

This project focuses on applying advanced CSS techniques to style the homepage created in the "HTML, advanced" project. The goal is to transform the raw HTML structure into a visually appealing and responsive webpage based on a provided Figma design.

We will be implementing various CSS properties, selectors, and layout techniques (like Flexbox and Grid, if applicable to the design) to match the designer's vision.

## Figma Design

The complete design specifications and visual guide for this project are available on Figma. It's highly recommended to "Duplicate to your Drafts" to have full access to all design details, including measurements, colors, and typography.

*   **Figma Page Link:** [Page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/vGk2SYk5e1x7h2X3qQ9Q8X/Foundations---CSS%2C-advanced)
*   **Figma File:** (Refer to the link above to access and duplicate the .fig file)

## Important Notes for Figma

*   **Fonts:** The design uses specific fonts. If your computer doesn't have them, you can download them here:
    *   [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
    *   Spin-Cycle-OT (Often found within design tool font packages or specific font repositories. Please ensure you have a license if required, or find a suitable open-source alternative if unavailable.)
*   **Float Values:** Some measurements in Figma might be float values (e.g., 10.5px). Feel free to round these to the nearest whole number for simplicity in CSS.

## Project Setup

1.  Ensure you have the `index.html` file from the "HTML, advanced" project in this directory.
2.  Create a new CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) in this directory.
3.  Link the CSS file to your `index.html` in the `<head>` section.
4.  Open `index.html` in your web browser to see your styles applied.
